As the village of the greatest forgers, it provides Demon Slayers with the finest weapons, which allow them to fight night-crawling fiends and ensure the safety of humans. After his sword was chipped and deemed useless, Tanjirou Kamado, along with his precious little sister Nezuko, is escorted to the village to receive a new one.\n\nMeanwhile, the death of an Upper Rank Demon disturbs the idle order in the demon world. As Tanjirou becomes acquainted with Mist Hashira Muichirou Tokitou and Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji, ferocious powers creep from the shadows and threaten to shatter the Demon Slayers' greatest line of defense.","subOrDub":"sub","type":"SPRING 2023 ANIME","status":"Completed","otherName":"\n                          鬼滅の刃 刀鍛冶の里編 \n                           鬼滅之刃 上弦集結，前進刀匠村 \n                           귀멸의 칼날: 도공 마을편 \n                           Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Swordsmith Village Arc \n                           Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Le village des forgerons \n                           Demon Slayer: Villa de Herreros\n                      ","episodes":[]}
