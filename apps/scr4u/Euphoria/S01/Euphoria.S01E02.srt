2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,830
I'm very happy for you, Rue.

3
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:10,694
You're about to start
a brand-new chapter.

4
00:00:10,943 --> 00:00:12,823
You think 'cause I went to rehab
I stayed clean?

5
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:17,444
Some new girl I think
you're gonna be friends with.

6
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:19,027
- I'm Rue.
- Jules.

7
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:20,569
Hi.

8
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:22,694
You're fucking crazy.

9
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:25,193
I'm just trying to get back
at my ex-boyfriend.

10
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,360
You can stay
in a town like this,

11
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:30,027
end up like me,

12
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,068
living your life out
in motel rooms.

13
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:34,360
Why don't you take your top off?

14
00:00:37,444 --> 00:00:38,485
I know what you want.

15
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:40,360
This bitch is gonna get
fucked up!

16
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:42,861
You wanna fucking hurt me?

17
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:46,444
Where you headed to?

18
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:48,902
Home.

19
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:51,569
And then... things got weird.

20
00:01:13,652 --> 00:01:16,152
Sometimes,
when I get really high,

21
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:17,402
I kind of think I'm psychic.

22
00:01:20,402 --> 00:01:25,027
When Nate Jacobs
was 11 years old,

23
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,470
he found his dad's
porn collection.

24
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:31,193
His dad, Cal, was obsessive.

25
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:34,277
His mom always said
that's who he got it from.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,919
Then he quickly realized
that the colored cases

27
00:01:35,943 --> 00:01:38,027
and placement were no accident.

28
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,319
It was an elaborate code,

29
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,242
one to ensure that no
one fucked with his shit.

30
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,694
I have a very
pretty dick. Do you want to see it?

31
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,003
What do
you like to be called? Mister?

32
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,485
Master?

33
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,193
Daddy?

34
00:01:54,277 --> 00:01:57,068
For y ou?
You can call me "Daddy."

35
00:01:57,152 --> 00:01:58,861
Open wider.

36
00:01:58,943 --> 00:02:00,569
Wider.

37
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:01,652
More like that.

38
00:02:04,777 --> 00:02:06,235
- Yeah!
- Good?

39
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,068
Yes, Daddy. I'll be good.

40
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:10,235
Every video was
basically the same.

41
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,652
Oh, you are all
woman, aren't you?

42
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:14,902
- Mostly.
- Mostly.

43
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:17,027
They'd drink, make small talk...

44
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,545
Oh, don't make me come.

45
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:21,110
I... I want to wait for that.

46
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:23,753
A nd then his
dad would fuck the shit out of some...

47
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:24,897
Fucking whore. Fucking slut.

48
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:06,319
I want to talk to you.

49
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:15,027
You're a strong man, Nathaniel.

50
00:03:15,902 --> 00:03:18,819
I knew it from the moment
you were born.

51
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:24,694
You have an... iron will,

52
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:27,985
drive, determination.

53
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:31,360
I've always admired that in you.

54
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:34,402
Because some day,
it will lead you to greatness.

55
00:03:40,736 --> 00:03:44,527
But no one in this world
will ever root for you.

56
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:49,110
They'll see what I see
and they'll despise you for it.

57
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:53,193
Sometimes you'll know,
and sometimes you won't.

58
00:03:53,277 --> 00:03:56,527
But the farther you go,
the sharper their blade.

59
00:03:57,943 --> 00:04:00,902
Just don't ever
give them an opening.

60
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:15,193
By 12, he had adopted a
rigid diet and workout schedule.

61
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:18,943
Within a year, his body fat
dropped from 23% to 6%.

62
00:04:42,943 --> 00:04:45,985
Ready? All right!

63
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:48,360
He joined the
football team as a freshman

64
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:49,444
and quickly excelled.

65
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:53,152
Red, 32, hut!

66
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:56,569
By the year's end,

67
00:04:56,652 --> 00:04:58,044
he was not only
the starting quarterback,

68
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:58,943
but the team captain.

69
00:04:59,027 --> 00:05:00,467
Keep it together, Nate.
Stay focused.

70
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:01,819
All right, let's fucking go!

71
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:18,902
He loved the crowds,

72
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,319
the pats on the back, the
cheers, the feeling of winning.

73
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:30,902
But he hated being
in the locker room.

74
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:32,545
He hated how casual his teammates
were about being naked...

75
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:37,152
Woo!

76
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:40,068
How they'd talk to him
with their dicks hanging out.

77
00:05:40,152 --> 00:05:44,861
He made a concerted effort to always
maintain eye contact during these exchanges.

78
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,943
Every now and then, he'd forget,

79
00:05:47,027 --> 00:05:49,067
and accidentally catch
a glimpse of someone's penis.

80
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:08,110
His older brother
Aaron was a fuck-up.

81
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:09,670
He could tell his dad
didn't like Aaron,

82
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:11,014
didn't think he had
guts or brains

83
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:12,402
or half a fucking clue.

84
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:13,485
And Nate agreed.

85
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:17,652
He didn't talk to his dad
that much,

86
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:19,652
but they didn't need to.

87
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:21,819
They had a good relationship.

88
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:24,235
He didn't like
his mother either.

89
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,652
She was weak, and a pushover.

90
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:28,319
Plus, she didn't
take care of herself.

91
00:06:28,402 --> 00:06:31,485
He made a long mental checklist

92
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:34,319
of the things he liked
and disliked about women.

93
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:37,319
He liked tennis skirts
and jean cut-offs,

94
00:06:37,402 --> 00:06:39,819
but not the kind so short
you could see the pockets.

95
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:42,319
He liked ballet flats and heels.

96
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,360
He hated sneakers
and dress shoes.

97
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:48,128
What was fine with sandals, as long as
they were worn with a fresh pedicure.

98
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:50,819
He liked thigh gaps,
hated cankles.

99
00:06:50,902 --> 00:06:54,819
He liked tan lines, long necks,
slender shoulders.

100
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:58,527
He liked good posture
and fruit-scented body mist.

101
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:01,611
He liked full lips,
and small noses.

102
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:03,777
He liked chokers,
but the lacy ones

103
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:05,777
with flower cutouts
or delicate patterns.

104
00:07:05,861 --> 00:07:08,193
He hated girls
who sat like boys,

105
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:11,694
talked like boys,
acted like boys.

106
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:13,943
But there was nothing
on planet Earth he hated more

107
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:15,652
than body hair.

108
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:21,527
That's one of the first things
he noticed about Maddy.

109
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:22,943
She was basically hairless.

110
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:30,694
He'd walk her home
from school every day.

111
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:34,652
It made him feel good to know
that he was there to protect her.

112
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:39,485
He knew the world was full of
men who wanted to hurt Maddy.

113
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:42,689
Men who would hang out the windows of
their cars and scream obscenities at her.

114
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:45,736
College guys who wouldn't
think twice about drugging her.

115
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:49,402
Lonely guys who'd spot her
at a mall.

116
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:54,319
Men who'd rape her, torture her,
sell her into sexual slavery.

117
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:55,882
He didn't
even like to think about it.

118
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:01,235
He did, however,

119
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,439
like to think about the
things he'd do to protect her.

120
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,569
If anyone ever tried to hurt
you, I'd kill them.

121
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:11,611
You're, like,
the sweetest guy ever.

122
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:18,277
He also liked that
Maddy was a virgin,

123
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,795
that no guy had ever
put his penis in her.

124
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:22,027
You're a virgin?

125
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:24,444
Yeah.

126
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:27,652
- Like, fully?
- Yeah.

127
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:30,235
What about like...

128
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,402
- Have you ever been fingered?
- Only my own.

129
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:43,360
He sometimes imagined marrying
Maddy and starting a family.

130
00:08:43,444 --> 00:08:46,277
He knew
he didn't want boys, though.

131
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,280
But he also didn't like
the idea of having girls.

132
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,652
Plus, Maddy could be
a real bitch.

133
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:55,569
Like that night
at McKay's party,

134
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:57,985
something just flipped.

135
00:08:58,068 --> 00:08:59,611
And he knew he had anger issues,

136
00:08:59,694 --> 00:09:00,894
but, I mean, so did every guy.

137
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:08,319
It's not like there was anything in
his life he could trace it back to.

138
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:10,777
It was just... who he was,

139
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:12,402
and who he'd always be.

140
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,527
What are you doing?

141
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:28,527
Nothing, I just came to...
came to say goodnight.

142
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Good night.

143
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:37,777
Good night.

144
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:13,068
It was the first day of
school, and my heart was racing.

145
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:24,861
I had made a new best friend, and for the
first time since getting out of rehab,

146
00:10:24,943 --> 00:10:26,319
I was feeling good
about the world.

147
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:29,943
I've got an idea.

148
00:10:31,777 --> 00:10:33,485
What?

149
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,193
Wanna get high?

150
00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:38,527
What is it?

151
00:10:39,193 --> 00:10:40,777
No idea.

152
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:43,485
Didn't you
just get out of rehab?

153
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:46,027
Yeah.

154
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,402
Should I be concerned?

155
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:50,277
Maybe.

156
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,943
I feel like
this isn't a good idea.

157
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,444
I kinda disagree.

158
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:01,819
Rue.

159
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:14,319
Do you feel anything?

160
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:16,736
Uh-uh.

161
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:21,819
Do you feel anything?

162
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:23,861
No.

163
00:11:24,943 --> 00:11:28,652
Rue, what's wrong?

164
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:32,277
Just so happy.

165
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,819
Whoa.

166
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:39,985
Whoa.

167
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:41,548
I know you're not
allowed to say it...

168
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,461
But drugs are kind of cool.

169
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:51,861
Whoa.

170
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:54,985
I mean, they're cool
before they wreck your skin...

171
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:56,828
and your life...

172
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,110
Can you grab me a towel?

173
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:02,068
And your family.

174
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:05,068
Gia,
I need you to grab me a towel.

175
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:06,795
- What have you got?
- I found her down.

176
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:09,444
I gave her one dose of Narcan...

177
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,277
That's when they get uncool.

178
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,902
It's actually a very
narrow window of cool.

179
00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:30,795
I'll wait with you
until your mother comes home.

180
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:34,277
You want to watch some TV?

181
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,240
And once you pass
through that window of cool...

182
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:39,777
This is embarrassing.

183
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,485
I feel like everyone knows.

184
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,777
Rue, I don't want to turn
this into a competition,

185
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:51,027
but, like, I win.

186
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:53,253
- For, like, a multitude of reasons.
- I just...

187
00:12:53,277 --> 00:12:55,652
I don't want to deal with
all the fucking questions.

188
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:57,611
I still win.

189
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:06,110
Wait, you're alive?

190
00:13:06,736 --> 00:13:09,402
Like, what the fuck?

191
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:13,402
Oh, shit, that's the girl who
tried to commit suicide at McKay's.

192
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:14,861
Wait, what?

193
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:18,152
Oh, yeah. I forgot.
You guys both was fuckin'.

194
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:22,402
Ugh! Why does everybody
think we fucked?

195
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:27,569
Now Maddy knew she
had an optics issue,

196
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:30,068
along with a mountain
of evidence against her.

197
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:32,110
So, last night,
while texting with Nate...

198
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:36,736
Maddy had an idea.

199
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:46,736
Alcohol is not good for me.

200
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:48,777
So you did fuck him.

201
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:52,277
- Honestly, I think I blacked out.
- For real?

202
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,110
Maddy!

203
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:55,527
Hey, you.

204
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:57,902
Oh, look! It's our new sexpert!

205
00:13:57,985 --> 00:14:01,943
- Congratulations, bitch!
- Welcome to the club!

206
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:04,068
Now, when Kat told
BB she lost her virginity

207
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:07,235
to some dude whose name
she didn't remember,

208
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:10,611
she knew she'd tell Maddy, and Cassie,
and the rest of the fucking planet Earth.

209
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:13,235
But that was kind of the point.

210
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,319
She was just relived
that it was no longer a thing.

211
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:33,943
Mm.

212
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:36,027
Hey, I'm Ethan.

213
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,652
Please don't be a mass shooter.

214
00:14:38,736 --> 00:14:40,319
What?

215
00:14:40,402 --> 00:14:43,985
Sorry, it's just, like,
the first thing that came to mind.

216
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:46,652
Oh, my God.

217
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:48,819
Am I giving off shooter vibes?

218
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:50,402
- Eh.
- Really?

219
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:52,985
- Eh, you know.
- Shit.

220
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:56,527
Look, I don't know.
What's your Reddit username?

221
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:59,611
Um, it's IncelUprising.

222
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:06,068
I'm joking. A joke.

223
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:10,819
I'm Kat.

224
00:15:10,902 --> 00:15:12,485
Uh, I'm Ethan.

225
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:14,985
Yeah, you said that.

226
00:15:15,068 --> 00:15:17,360
Okay, listen up, everybody.

227
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:20,027
Welcome to Biology 301.

228
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,319
So,
let's start with a little improvisation.

229
00:15:23,402 --> 00:15:28,444
I'd like each of you to get up and tell
us a five-minute story about your summer.

230
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:33,027
Looks like we have
OUR FIRST VOLUNTEER: Rue.

231
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,985
Please don't do this to me.

232
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,152
Come on, everyone.
Let's give her a little encouragement.

233
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:03,569
Um, a memory?

234
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:07,277
Anything that
had an impact on you this summer.

235
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,902
Uh, I don't... I don't...

236
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:14,277
I can't think of...

237
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:19,402
Just... relax your body.

238
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:22,611
Release the tension.

239
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:25,736
And just breathe.

240
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:30,152
We recommend taking her directly
to the rehabilitation center.

241
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:38,569
So this... this summer?

242
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:40,611
Yes.

243
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:03,360
Let's go.

244
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:12,444
I'm... I'm having trouble, uh,
like, remembering...

245
00:17:12,527 --> 00:17:13,861
uh, something, you know.

246
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:17,527
Just tell us a specific memory.

247
00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:20,193
Uh, okay. Uh...

248
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:24,319
I was, um, with my mom,
and my, uh, my little sister,

249
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:26,319
and we were, uh,
listening to this...

250
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:28,193
this song.

251
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:46,110
I know you know this song.

252
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:47,110
Are you doing drugs in my house?

253
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,777
What are you doing?

254
00:18:51,736 --> 00:18:53,193
Keep it!

255
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:55,402
I'm not joking!

256
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:57,861
I need to... I need to go!

257
00:18:57,943 --> 00:19:00,736
- Dad's so fucking proud, Mom.
- Oh, really?

258
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:03,152
Dad's so fucking proud.

259
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,402
Get off of me!

260
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:07,235
- I don't give...
- Get off of me!

261
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,527
Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up
and let me out of this fucking house.

262
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:17,611
Here we go now.

263
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:18,736
I'm sorry, but I...
I can't think of anything, so...

264
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:22,652
Just...

265
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:25,319
Um... uh...

266
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:28,027
I'm, uh... I'm done.

267
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,902
- Do I have to do this?
- She's a mess, dude.

268
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:35,027
Honestly, I bet
it's brain damage.

269
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,943
You're being fucking rude.

270
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:06,736
Fuck.

271
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:13,360
Rue, it's me.

272
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:17,861
Are you okay?

273
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,861
- You are so fucking stupid, Lexi.
- Why?

274
00:21:21,943 --> 00:21:24,902
'Cause I already flushed
everything down the fucking toilet.

275
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:26,444
Well, I just came
to check on you.

276
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:28,607
I don't w... I don't want
you to fucking check on me,

277
00:21:28,652 --> 00:21:30,319
whether I'm fine
or I'm not fine.

278
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:31,878
What difference are
you going to make?

279
00:21:31,902 --> 00:21:33,943
Are you going to give me
some life advice?

280
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,611
You gonna fucking help me?

281
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,652
Well, you're, like,
one of my best friends.

282
00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:40,861
Give me a fucking break. 'Cause we
went to fucking pre-school together?

283
00:21:41,652 --> 00:21:44,193
That does not make us
best fucking friends.

284
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:47,902
You say all this,
but what happens in three days

285
00:21:47,985 --> 00:21:50,902
when you knock on my door asking
me to piss in some Tylenol bottle?

286
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:53,402
What, you're gonna say
the opposite?

287
00:21:53,485 --> 00:21:56,694
How we've known each other since
pre-school and we're best friends?

288
00:21:56,777 --> 00:21:59,402
It's like you have
a split personality disorder.

289
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,444
Sorry if I miss the old you.

290
00:22:08,943 --> 00:22:11,319
I slept like shit, too.

291
00:22:12,902 --> 00:22:15,360
Yeah, I miss you.

292
00:23:26,777 --> 00:23:29,652
My name is Ali,
and I'm an addict.

293
00:23:29,736 --> 00:23:31,611
Hi, Ali.

294
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:33,819
Actually, an addict
is a nice word for it.

295
00:23:33,902 --> 00:23:36,611
I was a stone-cold crackhead.

296
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:40,110
I was also a firefighter,
so I thought, you know...

297
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:43,402
the two might cancel each other out.
As long as I saved lives,

298
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:46,235
I was well within my right
to destroy my own.

299
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:49,985
The problem was, I was...

300
00:23:51,027 --> 00:23:54,902
I was also a father,
to two young girls.

301
00:23:56,277 --> 00:23:58,777
My girls live in Texas.

302
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:02,277
I speak to them whenever I can.

303
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,777
Drugs can take away a lot.

304
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:10,652
The first time
I tried Oxycontin, I was 13.

305
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:15,277
What do these feel like?

306
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:20,819
They're the absolute worst.

307
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:26,652
I used to take care
of my dad after school

308
00:24:26,736 --> 00:24:29,376
because my mom had to take a second
job to cover the medical bills.

309
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:36,943
A state-issued nurse would
come by every day for two hours,

310
00:24:37,027 --> 00:24:39,107
and she'd, legit, just play
Candy Crush on her phone.

311
00:24:40,652 --> 00:24:43,902
But, anyway, the point is,

312
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:45,943
he had, like, a bunch of pills.

313
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,569
He was too out of
it to know I was high.

314
00:25:32,402 --> 00:25:35,819
And I always have
the best time with you.

315
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,943
Me, too.

316
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:40,235
Do you mind?!

317
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:51,777
Hey. Uh, I'm gonna need you
to do me a big favor.

318
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:53,985
You see, there are
a bunch of these meetings

319
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:56,777
that I was supposed to attend
that I didn't...

320
00:25:56,861 --> 00:25:59,235
actually attend, so...

321
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:03,193
I'm gonna need you
to backdate this slip.

322
00:26:04,902 --> 00:26:07,110
Uh, yeah.

323
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:10,694
Ethically, that's a line
I will not cross.

324
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,402
Hmm.

325
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:17,569
What if I, uh...

326
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:19,611
suck your dick?

327
00:26:26,277 --> 00:26:28,152
Like, in my car?

328
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:33,027
I'm 17, you fucking creep.
Sign the slip.

329
00:26:40,277 --> 00:26:42,360
Pleasure doing business
with you.

330
00:26:42,444 --> 00:26:44,611
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

331
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:56,444
Rue.

332
00:26:58,402 --> 00:27:00,110
Love you.

333
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:02,444
Love you, too.

334
00:27:35,985 --> 00:27:38,527
Um, I'm gonna be right back.

335
00:27:42,902 --> 00:27:44,611
Fuck, yeah.

336
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:47,444
Fucking slut.

337
00:27:49,694 --> 00:27:51,193
Oh, fuck!

338
00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:54,402
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck...

339
00:28:03,861 --> 00:28:07,611
Oh.

340
00:28:07,694 --> 00:28:09,943
She never admitted it,

341
00:28:10,027 --> 00:28:12,444
and no one could ever prove it,

342
00:28:12,527 --> 00:28:13,777
but we all knew it was her.

343
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:39,027
Or, I don't
know, I guess for Kat,

344
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,819
it probably felt like
we all knew.

345
00:28:41,902 --> 00:28:45,569
That's the weird thing
about the Internet.

346
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:47,611
Ten people can feel like
the whole world.

347
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:50,736
Psst.

348
00:28:51,402 --> 00:28:55,068
Meet me in the cafeteria
in five minutes. We need to talk.

349
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,027
Why?

350
00:28:59,777 --> 00:29:02,193
Listen, Kat.
I didn't do anything.

351
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:03,819
I told Roy not to post it.

352
00:29:03,902 --> 00:29:05,152
It doesn't matter, okay?

353
00:29:05,235 --> 00:29:07,943
He's still sending it to people
and saying it's me.

354
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:09,943
Look, I don't want
my life to be ruined,

355
00:29:10,027 --> 00:29:12,427
and I'm sure you don't want to
end up on a sex offender list.

356
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:14,277
Kat, you know
I'm not a sex offender.

357
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,360
It's child pornography,
you dumb fuck.

358
00:29:17,444 --> 00:29:20,861
But we're all under 18.
Children can't make child pornography.

359
00:29:20,943 --> 00:29:24,068
- Troy, Google it.
- I'm not googling child pornography.

360
00:29:24,152 --> 00:29:28,360
You know what? Fuck it.
Fuck it, I'm going to the police.

361
00:29:28,444 --> 00:29:30,193
All right! Okay.

362
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:32,943
Okay, okay, I get it.
What do you need?

363
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:35,861
First, for you to delete
the video off your phone

364
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,444
and whoever's phone
you sent it to.

365
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:39,027
That is done.

366
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,235
And for you to tell Wes to tell
everybody that it's not me.

367
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,777
- Okay?
- Okay. Done.

368
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:47,235
Anything else?

369
00:29:48,027 --> 00:29:51,360
Actually, yeah.

370
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:53,420
So even though Roy and
Troy tried to put an end to it,

371
00:29:53,444 --> 00:29:56,861
Kat? Nah.
It was some other bitch.

372
00:29:56,943 --> 00:30:00,027
Oh, dude. What the fuck?
I thought you said it was Kat.

373
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:03,569
I did, but, I mixed
that bitch up.

374
00:30:03,652 --> 00:30:04,795
By the end of the week...

375
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,925
Katherine Hernandez,

376
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,943
please report
to the principal's office.

377
00:30:23,027 --> 00:30:25,569
Katherine Hernandez
to the principal's office.

378
00:30:25,652 --> 00:30:26,961
I heard a very disturbing rumor.

379
00:30:26,985 --> 00:30:30,235
- About what?
- There is a recording of you

380
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:33,902
engaged in... sexual activity.

381
00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:36,277
Or something to that effect,

382
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,277
that is being shared
amongst the students.

383
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,360
Is this about that video of that
girl getting banged from behind?

384
00:30:42,444 --> 00:30:44,652
Because no, it's not me, but...

385
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,360
just out of sheer curiosity,

386
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,652
what could have possibly
led you to believe that is was?

387
00:30:48,736 --> 00:30:51,319
I just want to be clear...

388
00:30:51,402 --> 00:30:53,152
that I haven't personally
seen the video...

389
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:55,694
It is because the girl in the video is
fat, Principal Hayes?

390
00:30:55,777 --> 00:30:58,193
I'm not jumping
to conclusions, Katherine...

391
00:30:58,277 --> 00:31:02,360
Well, I'd just appreciate it if everyone would
stop talking to me like it was, because,

392
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:05,444
frankly, it's... offensive.

393
00:31:05,527 --> 00:31:07,837
You know, it's one thing for
my classmates to body shame me,

394
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:10,319
but for you,
Principal Hayes that's

395
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:13,193
just... a whole nother thing.

396
00:31:13,277 --> 00:31:16,777
It's degrading.
It's... discriminatory.

397
00:31:16,902 --> 00:31:19,819
And it just goes to show
how insidious, and...

398
00:31:19,902 --> 00:31:23,152
systemic body terrorism
truly is in this country.

399
00:31:23,235 --> 00:31:25,694
From my own principal.

400
00:31:26,444 --> 00:31:28,152
Well, I'm... I'm...

401
00:31:28,235 --> 00:31:31,152
I... I can't apologize enough.

402
00:31:31,235 --> 00:31:33,611
And I give you my word,

403
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:37,360
I will do everything in my power
to put an end to this rumor.

404
00:31:38,485 --> 00:31:42,485
Thank you, Principal Hayes.

405
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,420
And so on the same
way that mass shootings,

406
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,485
sex scandals,
and stolen elections do,

407
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:49,878
the whole thing blew over pretty quickly
and we all moved on to the next thing.

408
00:31:49,902 --> 00:31:50,819
- You guys pumped?
- Yeah!

409
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:53,985
- Are we gonna win?
- Yeah!

410
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:58,110
Then let's hear it for the
East Highland Blackhawks!

411
00:32:09,402 --> 00:32:12,277
Yeah, Nate!

412
00:32:39,985 --> 00:32:42,985
Hey! Oh.

413
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:48,861
Hey, let's go!

414
00:32:50,027 --> 00:32:52,319
I, 100 percent,
do not feel safe right now.

415
00:32:53,861 --> 00:32:56,861
No. So stay
the fuck out of my grill.

416
00:32:56,943 --> 00:32:58,777
Yo, Maddy.

417
00:32:58,861 --> 00:33:00,152
What?

418
00:33:00,235 --> 00:33:03,985
- Let me take you out tonight.
- Why?

419
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,193
- I hate you.
- I know.

420
00:33:12,277 --> 00:33:14,193
Seriously?

421
00:33:14,985 --> 00:33:16,235
Seriously?

422
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:19,235
Seriously.

423
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,444
I'm over it.

424
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:23,027
Rue!

425
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,652
Breathing is clearly
not a priority to you.

426
00:33:25,736 --> 00:33:29,943
- Ding, ding, ding!
- I see. Oh...

427
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,319
Fuck.

428
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:36,444
Uh, you wanna come over
for dinner tonight?

429
00:33:36,527 --> 00:33:38,193
Uh, I wish.

430
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:42,152
But my dad wants to have like a capital
F, capital D Family Dinner.

431
00:33:42,235 --> 00:33:44,694
Which is weird,
because it's literally just me and him

432
00:33:44,777 --> 00:33:47,527
eating dinner together,
like, every single night.

433
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,819
Well, um, what about later?

434
00:33:50,902 --> 00:33:54,319
I'm probably
gonna do some homework.

435
00:33:54,402 --> 00:33:55,642
Binge-watch some Madoka Magica.

436
00:33:55,694 --> 00:33:58,861
Okay, well, um,
maybe you could, like,

437
00:33:58,943 --> 00:34:03,694
come over Sunday night, 'cause my
mom's, like, asking me and stuff.

438
00:34:05,902 --> 00:34:08,985
Are you talking
to your momma about me?

439
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:10,985
No.

440
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:12,527
Shut up.

441
00:34:17,193 --> 00:34:19,444
- Bye, Rue.
- Bye.

442
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:25,360
I'm such a loser.

443
00:34:47,943 --> 00:34:51,068
Maddy, I just want to say
that I'm sorry.

444
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,110
Cash or credit?

445
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:24,027
- Christopher McKay.
- Yep.

446
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,402
Drove down from college
for the weekend.

447
00:35:27,485 --> 00:35:29,319
Yep. Mm-hmm.

448
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:34,152
So, what's in store
for Friday night, huh?

449
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:36,943
Uh, you know. Just... mm.

450
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:39,027
Oh.

451
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,110
Cassie's smitten like
a kitten with you.

452
00:35:42,193 --> 00:35:43,736
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

453
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:45,235
Yeah, she's a pretty cool girl.

454
00:35:45,319 --> 00:35:49,027
Well, I tell ya,
it's not easy to hold her attention.

455
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,527
Uh-uh. Like mother,
like daughter.

456
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:55,068
But she's a good girl.

457
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,110
She's got a good heart.

458
00:35:57,193 --> 00:35:59,777
Yeah. Handle with care.

459
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:03,777
- I will.
- Mom, stop talking to him.

460
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:07,027
Excuse me. I've been dismissed.

461
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:11,485
You have fun.
Ooh, you look so pretty.

462
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,152
Hey. Want to watch a movie?

463
00:36:17,902 --> 00:36:19,402
Yeah, come on.

464
00:36:25,611 --> 00:36:29,152
Maddy. Why don't you let me
take you out tonight?

465
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:31,819
I don't know. Text me.

466
00:37:02,193 --> 00:37:03,652
All right.

467
00:37:03,736 --> 00:37:06,068
No cell phones during dinner.

468
00:37:10,777 --> 00:37:14,152
I don't think I have an attention
span for real life anymore.

469
00:37:14,235 --> 00:37:17,152
Shut up, you smart ass.

470
00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:47,611
Hey, open the door!

471
00:37:51,694 --> 00:37:54,652
- What do you want?
- Open the fucking door.

472
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,482
- Yo, who is it, man?
- Rue.

473
00:38:01,527 --> 00:38:04,611
- No, bro, tell her to come back later.
- Yo.

474
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:06,694
Too late, bitch.

475
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:09,587
- Hold on, hold on. You can be in here right now.
- I see you, cash money.

476
00:38:09,611 --> 00:38:11,068
Nah, nah.

477
00:38:11,152 --> 00:38:13,360
Yo, I just need some,
uh, some OCs and some socks.

478
00:38:13,444 --> 00:38:15,736
I can't help you
right now. You got to go.

479
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:18,819
Yo, for real, Rue.
I ain't fuckin' playing with you. Come on.

480
00:38:18,902 --> 00:38:20,861
- You can't be in here.
- Look, Fez,

481
00:38:20,943 --> 00:38:23,902
I'm fucking drenched. Okay?

482
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:27,902
And, uh...
I'm out of drugs. So...

483
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:31,652
- don't be a dick.
- Oh, my God. That's not my fucking problem.

484
00:38:31,736 --> 00:38:33,485
You got to get up
out of my house right now

485
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:36,049
- before these motherfuckers come through.
- All I need...

486
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,027
- For real.
- Is a couple OCs,

487
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,402
and some Xannies.
That's all I need, and I can be gone.

488
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,694
Yo, I'm trying to tell you,
I don't got shit right now. Like...

489
00:38:43,777 --> 00:38:46,444
Come back in a few hours,
I got you, whatever you need.

490
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:49,319
But right now, you got to get
the fuck up outta my house.

491
00:38:49,402 --> 00:38:50,985
I know you have something, Fez.

492
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:54,527
I'm just telling you,
I don't got shit for you, Rue, come on.

493
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:56,611
I need you out the
house right now.

494
00:38:56,694 --> 00:38:58,975
My guy's about to come through here.
I don't want you here

495
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:00,919
when he gets here, you understand?

496
00:39:00,943 --> 00:39:03,027
- Give me drugs.
- This is dead serious.

497
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,943
Yo, Rue.

498
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:23,152
I could fucking kill you
right now.

499
00:39:26,527 --> 00:39:29,152
Yo, Ash, they're here.

500
00:39:40,027 --> 00:39:41,985
Look, I'm serious, Rue.

501
00:39:42,068 --> 00:39:46,319
Just stay right there,
keep your mouth shut, and be cool.

502
00:39:46,402 --> 00:39:50,777
These dudes
ain't fucking around.

503
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:53,378
Now, I'm not gonna lie. That's
when I started to get a little scared.

504
00:39:53,402 --> 00:39:55,762
I mean, I'm all good with drugs
until guns start coming out.

505
00:41:00,444 --> 00:41:02,878
Coming out of East Highland,
I've held the state record

506
00:41:02,902 --> 00:41:04,902
for most receiving yards
the last two years in row.

507
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:07,044
I broke East Highland records
for the most receptions,

508
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:08,985
the most yards
DURING THE GAME: 112,

509
00:41:09,068 --> 00:41:11,110
most yards per catch,
most yards after the catch.

510
00:41:11,193 --> 00:41:13,569
And I can fucking block.

511
00:41:13,652 --> 00:41:15,861
And this coach is acting like
he don't want to start me.

512
00:41:15,943 --> 00:41:19,402
Like I haven't earned my due on the
field or something. That's bullshit.

513
00:41:19,485 --> 00:41:21,652
Don't they do that to,
like, all the freshmen?

514
00:41:21,736 --> 00:41:24,152
I'm not all freshman.
Look at my stats.

515
00:41:24,235 --> 00:41:27,027
Shit pisses me off.
I don't get it.

516
00:41:30,861 --> 00:41:33,110
You want to kill him?

517
00:41:33,193 --> 00:41:34,402
What?

518
00:41:34,485 --> 00:41:36,777
Let's fucking kill him.

519
00:41:38,736 --> 00:41:42,569
Cass, I'm serious.

520
00:41:42,652 --> 00:41:44,985
It's not funny.
This motherfucker really pissed me off.

521
00:41:45,068 --> 00:41:46,943
Come on, McKay.

522
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:49,152
It just takes time.

523
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:58,485
I thought about you all week.

524
00:41:58,943 --> 00:42:01,193
I'm dying to fuck you.

525
00:42:03,611 --> 00:42:06,902
Why you got to make
everything so sexual?

526
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,902
What?

527
00:42:12,777 --> 00:42:15,235
I'm trying to have a real-ass
conversation with you.

528
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,193
I'm... I'm sorry.

529
00:42:26,235 --> 00:42:28,777
It's cool, Cassie.
It's all right.

530
00:42:45,402 --> 00:42:47,360
So this your little bitch?

531
00:42:47,444 --> 00:42:50,943
Nah, bruh,
that's like my little sister.

532
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,235
Well, hello, there, little sis.

533
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,152
Now, when Fez said
his dudes were coming over,

534
00:43:01,235 --> 00:43:02,712
I didn't think his dude
would be this dude.

535
00:43:02,736 --> 00:43:05,319
My name is Mouse.

536
00:43:05,402 --> 00:43:08,360
It's a pleasure to meet you.

537
00:43:08,444 --> 00:43:09,919
But you know,
that's what happens

538
00:43:09,943 --> 00:43:11,086
when you hang out
with drug dealers.

539
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,694
Yo, Custer, toss me that bag.

540
00:43:13,777 --> 00:43:15,985
All right, check it.

541
00:43:16,068 --> 00:43:18,569
I got a 100 OP
-OC 80s,

542
00:43:18,652 --> 00:43:21,444
500 Xanny bars, 50020s of Addy.

543
00:43:21,527 --> 00:43:23,652
I'm low on Vikes,
so if you wanna cop some Vikes,

544
00:43:23,736 --> 00:43:25,943
you better cop 'em today,
'cause I got, like, 50 left.

545
00:43:26,027 --> 00:43:30,861
I got a quap of that Cali
medicinal, and an ounce of Molly.

546
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,128
- Yo...
- Custer, what's the math on that?

547
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:34,943
Uh, 25, 15, and 1,100,

548
00:43:35,027 --> 00:43:38,193
35, 77, and 25...

549
00:43:38,277 --> 00:43:40,902
7,750.

550
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:48,444
Here.

551
00:43:50,485 --> 00:43:52,402
Sure you don't want no Fentanyl?

552
00:43:52,485 --> 00:43:54,777
Nah, man,
I'm cool off that shit.

553
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:58,068
There's too many ODs,
and I don't want the heat.

554
00:43:58,152 --> 00:44:01,569
How about you, little sis?
You ever try Fentanyl?

555
00:44:01,652 --> 00:44:04,819
- No.
- No, she's good, bruh.

556
00:44:06,235 --> 00:44:08,152
Gonna let big brother
talk for you?

557
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:12,027
- I don't know.
- Don't look at him. Look at me.

558
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:15,527
You ever try it?

559
00:44:16,652 --> 00:44:19,694
Yo, for real, bruh.
I don't want her fucking with that shit.

560
00:44:19,777 --> 00:44:22,319
You know that feeling
when you come so hard

561
00:44:22,402 --> 00:44:25,277
that you can't feel
or hear shit?

562
00:44:26,736 --> 00:44:30,360
- You like that feeling?
- Yeah.

563
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:34,319
Well, shit. You gonna love this.

564
00:44:40,943 --> 00:44:43,152
I'm... I'm good, actually.

565
00:44:43,235 --> 00:44:47,777
- What, you don't trust me?
- Yo, for real, man. She's good.

566
00:44:47,861 --> 00:44:52,193
Shut the fuck up, bitch.
Ain't nobody talkin' to you.

567
00:44:52,277 --> 00:44:55,777
Tell your big brother I'm
not talking to him right now.

568
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:58,444
Tell him, "Shut the fuck up."

569
00:44:58,527 --> 00:45:01,694
Come on. Don't be scared.
It's not gonna bite you.

570
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,527
Come on. Try it.

571
00:45:12,152 --> 00:45:13,444
Oh, just try it.

572
00:45:15,694 --> 00:45:21,277
Dear God, I know I've been
a cunt for, like, a lot of my life,

573
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,444
and I was mean to Lexi and my family
and I am so, so, so sorry, but...

574
00:45:24,527 --> 00:45:27,152
just please, God,
I'm begging you,

575
00:45:27,235 --> 00:45:29,402
do not let me die tonight.

576
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:50,235
Welcome home.

577
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,027
Fuck!

578
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:55,193
- What the fuck, man?
- Hi, Tyler.

579
00:45:55,277 --> 00:45:56,919
What the fuck
are you doing here, man?

580
00:45:56,943 --> 00:45:58,736
Get the fuck out
of my apartment.

581
00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:01,319
If you're looking for the kitchen
knives, they're here.

582
00:46:01,402 --> 00:46:04,110
Same with the baseball bat
from your room.

583
00:46:07,402 --> 00:46:09,319
Who the fuck are you, man?

584
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:14,444
I'm the boyfriend of the girl
that you raped on Saturday night.

585
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:19,402
No, no. Dude, what the fuck?
I wouldn't rape anyone.

586
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,943
I swear to God,
I didn't rape a girl, dude.

587
00:46:22,027 --> 00:46:23,027
Mm.

588
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,777
But I saw it.

589
00:46:24,861 --> 00:46:29,611
- You saw what?
- I saw you rape her in the pool.

590
00:46:33,152 --> 00:46:35,569
Wait... Wait a minute.
You're talking about that crazy chick

591
00:46:35,652 --> 00:46:38,569
that was at the party?
That chick was asking me to.

592
00:46:38,652 --> 00:46:40,861
I was the one
that was saying no.

593
00:46:40,943 --> 00:46:43,902
- She was blacked out.
- Dude, she wasn't blacked out, man.

594
00:46:43,985 --> 00:46:48,152
I swear to God, she asked me to fuck
her, like, right here, right now.

595
00:46:49,652 --> 00:46:51,861
Do you know how old she is?

596
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:57,861
- She's like, 18.
- Try 17.

597
00:46:57,943 --> 00:47:00,319
Fuck, dude,
she didn't say that to me.

598
00:47:00,402 --> 00:47:02,485
And how old are you?

599
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:05,402
- I'm like, 21.
- You're 22.

600
00:47:05,485 --> 00:47:09,777
- I mean, barely.
- You turned 22 five months ago, Tyler. Don't fucking lie to me.

601
00:47:11,527 --> 00:47:15,485
So, not only did you rape a
girl, but you raped a minor.

602
00:47:17,193 --> 00:47:19,068
- I'm gonna hurt you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

603
00:47:19,152 --> 00:47:22,027
Yeah, and you're not gonna press
charges, because if you do,

604
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:25,110
you're gonna go to jail
for a lot longer than I will...

605
00:47:25,193 --> 00:47:27,861
- Please.
- Depending on what I do to you.

606
00:47:27,943 --> 00:47:30,423
Please, please, please, I am begging
you, please don't do this.

607
00:47:30,485 --> 00:47:33,068
Dude, don't hurt me, please.
Don't do this.

608
00:47:33,152 --> 00:47:35,777
- Get on your knees.
- What?

609
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:37,819
Get on your knees.

610
00:47:37,902 --> 00:47:41,360
NO. I'M NOT...
Hey, get on your knees. Come on.

611
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,985
Did you seriously think you could rape
a girl and nobody would do anything?

612
00:47:47,068 --> 00:47:49,360
Oh!

613
00:47:49,444 --> 00:47:52,569
Oh, my God. Fuck!

614
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:54,736
I didn't do anything, man!

615
00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:57,652
I'm gonna ask you a question.

616
00:48:00,902 --> 00:48:02,569
- Did you rape her?
- No.

617
00:48:04,235 --> 00:48:06,652
- Did you rape her?
- No! Fuck!

618
00:48:06,736 --> 00:48:09,193
Did you rape her?

619
00:48:09,277 --> 00:48:11,319
- Admit it! Did you rape her?
- Fucking ow!

620
00:48:11,402 --> 00:48:13,027
Admit it! Did you rape her?

621
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,985
Ow! Fuck! No!

622
00:48:16,068 --> 00:48:17,319
Admit it, you fucking faggot!

623
00:48:17,402 --> 00:48:19,569
Did you rape her?
Did you fucking rape her?

624
00:48:19,652 --> 00:48:22,777
I didn't fucking rape her!

625
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:47,902
It hits quick.

626
00:48:54,277 --> 00:48:56,777
You like the way that feels?

627
00:48:58,777 --> 00:49:00,360
Yeah.

628
00:49:00,444 --> 00:49:02,360
You want a couple
of patches, girl?

629
00:49:02,444 --> 00:49:05,235
Uh... okay.

630
00:49:12,611 --> 00:49:14,777
It's gonna cost you 300.

631
00:49:14,861 --> 00:49:17,985
Come on. Pay up, little sis.

632
00:49:18,068 --> 00:49:21,402
I only have two dollars.

633
00:49:21,485 --> 00:49:23,652
I said 300.

634
00:49:26,736 --> 00:49:29,485
Where are my pants?

635
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:34,360
I'll just...
I'll just give it back.

636
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,943
I got a strict no-return policy.

637
00:49:37,027 --> 00:49:39,652
Yo, Mouse.
Let me pay for it, man.

638
00:49:39,736 --> 00:49:42,235
I thought you was too good
for Fentanyl.

639
00:49:42,985 --> 00:49:46,193
What is it? Everybody's changing
their motherfucking minds on me?

640
00:49:46,277 --> 00:49:48,652
Yeah.

641
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:54,319
If she can't afford it, she gonna
have to find another way of paying me.

642
00:49:54,402 --> 00:49:56,235
- Straight up.
- Okay.

643
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,943
Yo, man, just let me pay for it.

644
00:50:02,943 --> 00:50:05,527
I got the money right here.

645
00:50:07,527 --> 00:50:08,569
Here.

646
00:50:09,277 --> 00:50:11,319
Dang. Big brother must love you.

647
00:50:11,402 --> 00:50:13,819
It's gonna cost you

648
00:50:13,902 --> 00:50:16,402
Damn. You gonna do me
like that, bruh?

649
00:50:16,485 --> 00:50:18,777
Yeah, I'm gonna do you
like that. Straight up.

650
00:50:18,861 --> 00:50:20,402
- Get that shit.
- Mm.

651
00:50:20,485 --> 00:50:22,360
There it is.

652
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:31,485
It's always a pleasure
doing business with you.

653
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,985
Go flush that
shit down the toilet,

654
00:50:41,068 --> 00:50:44,527
and go grab the Narcan,
just in case.

655
00:51:05,152 --> 00:51:07,694
I'm so happy.

656
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,943
I know.

657
00:53:05,277 --> 00:53:06,985
Yo, what's up? It's Fe z.

658
00:53:07,068 --> 00:53:11,193
Yeah, look. I'm gonna need
a little help with Rue.

659
00:53:12,694 --> 00:53:14,527
Yeah. ASAP.

660
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:17,652
All right.

661
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,402
Holy shit.

662
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,027
- That guy you fucked in the pool?
- What?

663
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:53,277
- Are you sure you don't remember?
- Mm-mm.

664
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,277
I don't believe you.

665
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,152
- Was it good?
- What?

666
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,943
The sex.

667
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:02,861
What do you want to know, Nate?

668
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:05,943
You want to know
if his dick was bigger?

669
00:56:06,027 --> 00:56:07,611
Was it?

670
00:56:07,694 --> 00:56:10,068
What if it was?

671
00:56:10,152 --> 00:56:11,611
I'd fucking kill him.

672
00:56:11,694 --> 00:56:14,943
Yeah, but dead or alive,
he'd still have a bigger dick than you.

673
00:56:44,152 --> 00:56:46,569
I got you a present.

674
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:48,861
Thank you.

675
00:57:25,027 --> 00:57:26,444
Ew.
